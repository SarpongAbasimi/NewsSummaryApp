Imporovements

> I think the application currently has all the main features, but there are still lots to be done.

- Currently the app is not fully responsive as I would like it to be.
- This is becasue I can't predict the sizes of the images being provided by the guardian API.

> One would say, why not set the images to a smaller with in using css ?

- The problem is that, some of the images from the guardian API are originally really small, therefore setting the size to a small with would make the smaller images even smaller and that will affect the user experience.
